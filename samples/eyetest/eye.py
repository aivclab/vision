    crescent width to eye depth

     For a crescent to be visible, the refractive error must exceed a critical magnitude (the dead zone). If 2,., e,
     and d are held constant, the crescent width s will expand rapidly as the refractive error in diopters increases
     until a critical value is reached at Â±5 D, beyond which changes in crescent width become Ie s perceptible.
